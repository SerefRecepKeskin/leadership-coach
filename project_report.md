- Plain HTTP communication
- No input validation
- No data encryption at rest

### Recommended Enhancements

3. Context processing

### Optimization Strategies
1. **LLM Optimization**
   - Model quantization
   - Batch processing
   - Response streaming

   - Index optimization
   - Caching frequently accessed vectors
   - Search parameter tuning

3. **System Level**
   - Load balancing
   - Connection pooling
   - Resource allocation optimization

## Project Constraints and Limitations

The current implementation was developed under significant time constraints (approximately 1 person-day) while balancing professional workload and graduate studies. As a result, several compromises were made in the development process:

1. **Security Implementation**: Security features were deliberately omitted to focus on core functionality.

2. **Text Chunking Approach**: The implemented overlap method for text chunking is functional but not optimal. More semantic chunking approaches would yield better context preservation.

3. **Vector Search**: Simple vector search is implemented, but hybrid approaches (like combining with BM25 for higher precision) would improve retrieval quality.

4. **Model Deployment**: Currently using Llama-3.3 via vLLM client. The architecture supports switching to commercial API-based LLMs with minimal changes.

5. **Testing Coverage**: Limited testing due to time constraints.

## TODO and Future Enhancements

### Short-term Improvements
1. Implement basic security measures (authentication, encryption)
2. Enhance text chunking with semantic approaches
3. Implement hybrid search combining vector and keyword-based retrieval (BM25)
4. Add comprehensive input validation and error handling
5. Improve logging and monitoring capabilities

### Long-term Roadmap
1. Multi-user support with authentication
2. Real-time content updates
3. Custom model fine-tuning
4. Advanced analytics dashboard
5. API rate limiting and monitoring
6. Automated testing pipeline
7. Explore commercial API integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
8. Implement more sophisticated RAG techniques (reranking, query expansion)
9. Enhance Whisper integration with customized ASR models for specific domains

## Technical Requirements
- CPU: 4+ cores
- RAM: 8GB+ (16GB recommended)
- Storage: 10GB+ SSD
- Docker Engine 20.10+
- Docker Compose 2.0+
- Internet bandwidth: 10Mbps+
- GPU: Optional but recommended for Whisper ASR and vLLM inference

## Conclusion
The Leadership Coach Platform demonstrates a functioning implementation of AI-powered coaching using modern technologies. While the current version serves as a proof of concept with known limitations due to time constraints, the architectural decisions and implementation patterns provide a solid foundation for scaling and enhancing the system for production use. The project successfully integrates frontend, backend, and data engineering concepts despite the limited development time allocation.
